git-submerge
============

Merge Git submodule into the repo, as if they've never been separate at all.



Suppose you have a repo with a submodule. Their collective history might look
like this:

    repository   A-B----D-E-F----H-----K----M---O   master
                       ;        ;          ;
                      ;        ;          ;
    submodule        C--------G----I-J---L----N     master

(Semicolons are gitlinks; we'll use slashes for merges.)

After running `git submerge submodule`, the history will look like this:

    repository   A-B---D'-E'-F'--H'--------K'--M'----O'   master
                    \ / \       / \           /
                     C'  ------G'  --I'-J'---L'---N'      sub-master

The following things happened:

* submodule got replaced by an ordinary directory;

* submodule's history became part of the repo's history;

* where submodule updates were previously (commits D, H, M), we now have merge
  commits;

* the yet-unmerged "tail" of the submodule history (commit N) is given its own
  branch so you can merge it yourself later.

Just as any other kind of history rewriting, this operation changes the hashes
of the commits, so you shouldn't run it on published histories.


How it works
============

Let's take another look at the history we saw before:

    repository   A-B----D-E-F----H-----K----M---O   master
                       ;        ;          ;
                      ;        ;          ;
    submodule        C--------G----I-J---L----N     master

Suppose the submodule is checked out into a directory called "sub".

`git submerge` proceeds in the following way:

0.  `git remote add sub ./sub && git fetch sub`
1.  `git submodule status sub` shows SHA-1 of the tip of the submodule (with indicator showing if it has uncommitted changes).
2.  `git branch sub-master b7301743fb1aee09d7dd6fda1a2d3e5dc0dfc79c` (the tip of the submodule)
3.  `git filter-branch --tree-filter 'mkdir sub; git mv -k * .??* sub' sub-master`
4.  `git checkout c47c102` (the commit before the one that added the submodule)
5.  `git checkout -b submerged`
6.  `git cherry-pick --no-commit 22b227e` (the commit that added the submodule)
7.  Look up submodule's commit ID with `git submodule status sub` (59d859dc0fab7ba7ea6ecc400c48b8d307ea519f), find corresponding commit in rebased history (015ae65)
7.  `git rm -rf sub` (`--force` is required because the directory is present in the index. This will remove the entry from the .gitmodules file, but won't remove the file itself even if it's empty)
8.  `[ -e .gitmodules -a ! -s .gitmodules ] && git rm -f .gitmodules` (remove the file if it's empty)
9.  Problem: replace a commit adding the submodule by a commit merging the head of submodule's rebased history into current branch.

    What I tried:

    ```
    git cherry-pick 22b227e
    git rm -r sub
    [ -e .gitmodules -a ! -s .gitmodules ] && git rm -f .gitmodules
    git ci --amend --allow-empty
    git merge --allow-unrelated --no-commit 015ae65
    git ci --amend
    ```

    Got: `fatal: You are in the middle of a merge -- cannot amend.`

10. Problem: `cherry-pick`ing produces different hashes on different invocations (probably because Committer Date is changing)


Current (20170610) idea:
    1. Run filter-branch on sub's master branch to move everything under sub/.
    2. Walk over the repo's master, note down commit IDs where sub/ is touched and which sub's commit IDs are used.
    3. Walk old and new sub's histories in lockstep, fill out the previous list with new commit IDs. We now have a mapping between old and new commit IDs.
    4. Run filter-branch over repo's master, with two filters:
        tree-filter that `rm -rf sub` if it's updated;
        parent-filter that adds new sub's commit ID as a parent to every commit where sub was updated.


1.  Rewrites submodule history, moving all files into a directory called "sub".
    This yields the following history:

        C'--G'--I'--J'--L'--N'

    Guaranteed not to have conflicts because moving stuff doesn't introduce or
    remove any changes.

2.  Check out `D`. De-init the submodule, remove its directory. Create merge
    commit with parents `B` and `C'`.

    (TODO: manually check if this is really possible and works as described.)

    History at this point:

                         C'-------G'---I'-J'---L'----N'
                          \
                         --D'
                        /
        repository   A-B----D-E-F----H-------K----M-----O   master
                           ;        ;            ;
                          ;        ;            ;
        submodule        C--------G----I--J----L-----N     master

    Guaranteed not to have conflicts because:

    * `C'` is known to contain just submodule's directory;

    * `B` *might* contain submodule's directory, but D must've fixed this,
      otherwise it couldn't add the submodule.


                         C'  -----G3---I3-J3---L3----N3
                          \ /
                         --D'
                        /
        repository   A-B----D-E-F----H-------K----M-----O   master
                           ;        ;            ;
                          ;        ;            ;
        submodule        C--------G----I--J----L-----N     master

    Guaranteed not to have conflicts because:

    * `G'` followed `C'` and changed just the submodule's subdirectory (the
      latter is ensured because we've moved *everything* to submodule's
      subdirectory on step 1);

    * `D'` inherited its submodule's subdirectory from `C'`, so from `G'`'s
      viewpoint, `D'` and `C'` are kinda the same.


                         C'  ---------G3---I3-J3---L3----N3
                          \ /
                         --D'--E'--F'
                        /
        repository   A-B----D-E-F----H-------K----M-----O   master
                           ;        ;            ;
                          ;        ;            ;
        submodule        C--------G----I--J----L-----N     master

    Guaranteed to not have conflicts because:

    * `E` followed `D` and changed everything *but* the submodule's
      subdirectory (the latter is ensured by Git itselfâ€”changes to submodule's
      contents would have been committed to the submodule itself, not to the
      containing repo);

    * `D'` contains the same stuff as `D` had, save for submodule's
      subdirectory which `E` doesn't touch.

    Same logic applies with `F` being cherry-picked onto `E'`.

                         C'  ---------G3---I3-J3---L3----N3
                          \ /          \
                         --D'--E'--F'---H'
                        /
        repository   A-B----D-E-F----H-------K----M-----O   master
                           ;        ;            ;
                          ;        ;            ;
        submodule        C--------G----I--J----L-----N     master

    Guaranteed not to have conflicts because submodule's directory hasn't been
    touched by `E'` and `F'` (see proofs above), and `G3` doesn't touch
    anything else (so won't conflict with changes introduced by `E'` and `F'`).


                         C'  ---------G3  -I4-J4---L4----N4
                          \ /          \ /
                         --D'--E'--F'---H'
                        /
        repository   A-B----D-E-F----H-------K----M-----O   master
                           ;        ;            ;
                          ;        ;            ;
        submodule        C--------G----I--J----L-----N     master

    Guaranteed not to have conflicts by the same logic as when we rebased `G3`
    from `C'` onto `D'`.
